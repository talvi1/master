Road roughness data is expensive and painstaking to gather. A new approach minimizes the overall
cost of such systems by building a low cost and modular
system that can be used to take measurements of the road
roughness and can be used to supplement the more expensive
equipment to map all of the roadways. The system supports the measurement of road surface
roughness where data is not currently being collected such as
smaller rural municipalities roads and residential city roads.
The measurement of road roughness along with images that
provide visual reference are used to quantify road surface
conditions.
The system uses three roughness sensors (accelerometers)
with two mounted over the back wheels in the car and a
third inside the car that transmit real time roughness data
wirelessly to a central terminal situated in the car. The
car position is tracked with a GPS sensor that organizes
the data transmitted to the central terminal with location
coordinates of the car. At the same time a camera, attached
to the central terminal, captures images of the road surface
and the surroundings as the car is moving. The captured
roughness and image data are stored in the central terminal.
Afterwards, automated scripts process the data using digital
signal processing tools to analyze the accelerometer and
image data to extract usable information from the data. The
required information is processed on the central terminal,
which uploads the data to a server. A website is used
to display the information regarding road roughness and
conditions in an intuitive and accessible format.
